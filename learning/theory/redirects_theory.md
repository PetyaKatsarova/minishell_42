1. output redirect >
===============================

ls -l >> newf âœ…
ls > newfile âœ…


ls >> bla <ls >> bla < bla âœ…
echo bla tra la la > b2 < b3 âœ… âœ˜ deletes b2 content, get msg: no b3 file 
echo hello > file1 > file2 âœ…
ls >> bla < bla2 âœ…

==========================
1. âœ…
echo hi > output.txt < missing.txt
Expected (Bash):
output.txt is created and empty.
Error: missing.txt: No such file or directory
===============================
2. âœ…
echo hi > output.txt < input.txt
Expected:
output.txt created/truncated
Contents of input.txt can be read (if your shell reads it)
=========================================
3. âœ…
echo hi > out1.txt < in1.txt < in2.txt
if in1.txt exists but in2.txt does not:
Expected:
out1.txt is created
Error: in2.txt: No such file or directory
No output from echo
====================================
4. âœ…
cat < bla | grep la | wc -w > bla2 x
if bla doesnt exits: get msg: no such file or dir bla, bla2 is created if not exists and has 0
========================================



 âœ˜

< bla2:

Bash tries to open bla2 for reading (stdin redirection).

!!NB!!
Bash runs cmds from left to right, however:
Bash opens all redirection files before executing the command.
If input.txt doesn't exist â†’ error, command not run.
If output.txt doesn't exist â†’ it is created immediately (even if command later fails).

If bla2 does not exist, bash prints:

bash: bla2: No such file or directory
Command is not executed.

>> bla:

This would append stdout to bla, but it never happens if bla2 is missing.

âœ… Expected behavior in bash:
If bla2 does not exist, you'll see:
bash: bla2: No such file or directory

âœ˜

ls >> bla <ls >> bla < bla
bash: ls: No such file or directory


================================

minihell: ls: No such file or directory
ls: Bad file descriptor in what cases will get this: waht cmd in shell can invoke 


ChatGPT said:
Youâ€™ll see:

yaml
Copy
Edit
minihell: ls: No such file or directory
ls: Bad file descriptor
when both happen:

Your shell can't find ls (e.g., not in $PATH or wrong name):

get_command_path() fails

sets last_exit_status = 127

prints: minihell: ls: No such file or directory

Your shell still tries to execute ls, or sets up its redirections using invalid file descriptors:

for example, < ls treats ls as an input file

file doesn't exist â†’ open() fails â†’ fd = -1

then you call dup2(-1, STDIN_FILENO) â†’ triggers:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls: Bad file descriptor
ðŸ§ª Example command that causes this:
bash
Copy
Edit
ls >> out < ls
Assuming no file named ls exists, this leads to:

"No such file or directory" from trying to open ls as input

"Bad file descriptor" if your shell still tries to dup2() or execve() despite the error

âœ… Fix:
In your shell:

After any failed open(), do not call dup2() or execve()

Skip execution if redirection setup failed


===================================
 Bash Handles Redirection in This Order:
Lexical parsing: Bash reads the command and splits it into tokens.

Redirection parsing: Redirections like <, >, >>, 2>, etc., are processed before the command runs.

File descriptor manipulation: File descriptors are opened or redirected based on parsed instructions.
